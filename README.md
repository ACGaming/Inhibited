## Inhibited

###### Inhibits player abilities through one simple effect!

![Inventory status effect](effect_inv.png)

When the 'Inhibited' effect is active, players get set into adventure mode, restricting the player's abilities.

Since this effect is intended to be triggered by other means, no actual potions are added and only commands are used.

Example: `/effect Player inhibited:inhibited 30 0 true`
